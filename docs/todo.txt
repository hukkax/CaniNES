CaniNES TODO
=============================================================================

Bugs:
- ?

Mappers:
- Missing a number of uncommon Asian mappers that Mesen supports
- Expansion audio missing for Jaleco mappers (in Mesen too)
- Missing 24C01/24C02 EEPROM implementations used by Bandai FCG mapper
- VRC7 OPLL audio implementation has an unidentified bug that might cause 
  noisy audio on occasion
- 172 Venice Beach Volleyball (Asia) (En) (Super Mega) (Unl) has
  initialization problems on first run; reset fixes it;
  036 Volley Ball (Spain) (Gluk Video) (Unl) has no problem.
  Works fine in Mesen, mapper seems fine, need to check console init code

Missing features:
- Manually change/turn FDS disks
- NSF player
- Patches in other formats than IPS
- Manual patching of ROMs; only automatic for now
- Support for more exotic hardware such as paddles/mice, only Zapper
- Support for NES-based arcade machines
- Screenshotting
- Movie capture

No plans to implement:
- Savestates are incompatible with Mesen
- All the debugging functionality from Mesen (no point in replicating)
- HD pack support
- Video recording
- FCEU movie playback tends to desync (in Mesen too, probably unfixable)
