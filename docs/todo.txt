CaniNES TODO
=============================================================================

Code:
- Menubar handling needs simplification, code is too hairy
- A general widget engine wouldn't hurt, could use one for Basement anyway

Bugs:
- Small issues with menubar toggling

Mappers:
- Missing a number of uncommon Asian mappers that Mesen supports
- Expansion audio missing for Jaleco mappers (in Mesen too)
- Missing 24C01/24C02 EEPROM implementations used by Bandai FCG mapper
- VRC7 OPLL audio implementation has an unidentified bug that might cause 
  noisy audio on occasion

Missing features to be possibly implemented:
- Screenshotting
- Manually change/turn FDS disks
- Manual patching of ROMs; only automatic for now
- Support for more exotic hardware such as paddles/mice

No plans to implement:
- All the debugging functionality from Mesen (no point in replicating)
- Savestates are incompatible with Mesen
- Savestates not supported in movies
- Non-MMO movie playback tends to desync (in Mesen too)
- Movie capture
- NSF player
- HD pack support
- Video recording
- Patches in other formats than IPS
- Support for NES-based arcade machines
